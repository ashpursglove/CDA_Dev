Hi Guys! 

Here is the program and an example excel input file.

This code has a few dependancies on libraries that will need to be installed as below:

psychrolib
openpyxl
tkinter 

just apt-get or pip these into your environment before you run the code and it should work fine.

go in the excel and put the numbers you want for the calculations and save it.

Now run the python script (ash_calc) using python 3 so type in

python3 ash_calc.py

This should start the program, now in the text box enter the just name of the excel file with all your data in.
In this example the file is co2.xlsx so just type co2 in the box and click "process file" this will calculate and display all the data.

As always, any issues just ask!
